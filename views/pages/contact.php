I believe in constantly practising and applying new ideas and best practices to        improve myself as a Web Developer. Recently, I have been working to        develop this website called <span class="emphasise">‘Articles By U’</span>, where users can register and write        their own articles on different topics and share their thoughts and ideas with        the world.        It is a personal project, which I have developed using <span class="emphasise">HTML, CSS, Javascript,        PHP and MYSQL</span>. I have designed the structure of this project using <span class="emphasise">MVC</span>        architectural pattern, which has been a great learning experience.        I am still working to improve the website, as it is by no means perfect.     </p>             <p class="aboutme">            I love web programming and have recently passed my <span class="emphasise">Zend Certified PHP​ Engineer</span> Exam.
